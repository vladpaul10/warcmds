# Warcmds

Warcmds is an AMX MOD X plugin designed for Counter-Strike 1.6 to enhance matchmaking control within the game.

I initiated this project during my high school years out of my passion for online gaming. The first version was launched in the ninth grade, and over the course of a year, I developed and tested the plugin on 5-10 competitive servers. I continually refined the plugin based on player feedback, making it a significant milestone in my journey into software engineering.

## Installation

To install Warcmds, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `amxmodx` directory to the `addons` path of your Counter-Strike 1.6 server.

You can also use the [Online Compiler](https://www.amxmodx.org/webcompiler.cgi "AMX Mod X - Half-Life Scripting for Pros!") for convenience.

## Usage

Warcmds provides several chat and console commands for in-game management:

### Chat Commands
- `/rr` or `/restart`: Restart the game.
- `/warm`: Initiate a warm-up phase.
- `/live`: Switch to live gameplay.
- `/blades`: Activate special blades mode.
- `/elections`: Start in-game elections.
- `/stop`: Halt ongoing actions.
- `/score`: Display the current score.

### Console Commands
